Welcome to *The Weekly Journal*. Here I will try to compile link,blogposts etc which I read that week. This week I will start with a little look back on 2020.

2020 like everyone else I remained constantly worrying, but I did manage to read some books and try out few things as follows

- *12 week a year* - I can say till now the most influencing blinks that I read. It speaks about how we can create shorter goal to keep ourselves focused on achieving that. 

- *Deep Work* - Another masterpiece by Cal Newport about gaining laser focus to produce high value work.

- *Netflix No Rules Rules* - Describing Netflix's culture of *Freedom & Responsibility*

- *FastAI* - FastAI is a Deeplearning library , also a course created by Jeremy Howard. This not only lessen the entry barrier to DeepL but also amaze me with its application first approach.

Other than I like to mention some magazine, podcasts and newsletter that I enjoyed

- *Java Magazine*
- *Java Annotated Monthly By Jetbrains*
- *Bootiful Podcast by Josh Long*

Now coming to 2021. Slow start after a vacation- 

- Watch *Cassava Leaf Disease Detection by Abhishek Thakur* - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBvUrj0FUiw

- Spring cloud Ilford is released. Surprised by changes introduced by Spring Sleuth (which is good) and it's removal of ribbon,hystrix package means you are kind of forced to move in the direction of Spring Cloud LoadBalancer and Spring cloud Circuitbreaker.

- To my surprise discovered Micronaut data does not have support for `createdBy` which is kind of meh . Opened PR https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data/issues/506

That's all for this week and a Happy new year !!
